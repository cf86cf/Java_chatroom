# Java_chatroom
my first project
 
This is a java project about socket and swing.
I also used MySQL to storage users' information.
Use Mail to send e-mail to check the registration.
By creating some frame window to display the function.

### The project should apart for two parts.
One is chatroom. The other is server.


### I put them in the main.java
you just need to run two file in order.
Start the server first, at the same time, we open a port to transport contents between clients and server.
Then you can run serveral clients to test the chatroom.

If you have any question, mail me to get detials.
